## ðŸš€ Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the automated test suite locally.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the Week-4 directory
git clone <repo-url>
cd MLops_assignment_solutions/week-4

# 2. Install Python dependencies
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Make the test runner script executable and run it
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh

# 4. (Optional) Run pytest directly for more detailed output
python -m pytest -v --cov=.

# 5. To see CI/CD in action, push changes to a new branch and open a Pull Request on GitHub.
```

The `run_tests.sh` script will execute the entire test suite, providing a summary of the results. The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run automatically on pull requests to the `main` branch.

## Problem Statement

### Core Challenge
As ML projects mature, the lack of automated testing and integration processes leads to significant challenges that hinder velocity and reliability:
- **Silent Failures**: Data or code changes can break the pipeline without explicit errors, leading to degraded model performance.
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: The "it works on my machine" problem becomes common, making it difficult to reproduce results across different environments.
- **Manual Overhead**: Manually running tests, validating models, and deploying changes is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable.
- **Slow Feedback Loops**: Developers wait for long periods to know if their changes have introduced regressions, slowing down the development cycle.
- **Training-Serving Skew**: Without rigorous testing, subtle differences between training and serving environments can go undetected.

### Specific Problem
**Objective**: Implement a production-grade testing and CI/CD workflow that demonstrates:
1.  **Comprehensive Unit and Integration Testing**: Validate individual components and the end-to-end pipeline.
2.  **Automated Test Execution**: Automatically run the test suite on every code change.
3.  **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that new code integrates correctly with the existing codebase.
4.  **Automated Reporting**: Generate and post test results, coverage, and performance metrics automatically.
5.  **Standardized Git Workflow**: Enforce a development workflow that leverages CI/CD for quality assurance.

### Business Impact
- **Increased Velocity**: Automate repetitive tasks to allow developers to focus on building features.
- **Improved Reliability**: Catch bugs and regressions early, before they reach production.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Provide a common framework for ensuring code quality across the team.
- **Reduced Risk**: Deploy changes with confidence, knowing they have passed a suite of automated checks.

## Approach to Reach Objective

### 1. **Testing Framework Design**
-   **Test Suite**: Develop a comprehensive test suite using `pytest` covering configuration, data validation, model training, and performance.
-   **Test Granularity**: Implement both unit tests for isolated components and integration tests for the full pipeline workflow.
-   **Local Test Runner**: Create a shell script (`run_tests.sh`) to simplify running tests in a local development environment.

### 2. **CI/CD Architecture**
-   **Platform**: Utilize **GitHub Actions** for its native integration with the source code repository.
-   **Workflow Triggers**: Configure the CI pipeline to run automatically on `push` events to development branches and `pull_request` events targeting `main`.
-   **Automated Reporting**: Integrate **Continuous Machine Learning (CML)** to post detailed reports as comments on pull requests.

### 3. **Implementation Strategy**
-   **Modular Tests**: Organize tests in `test_pipeline.py` with clear categories and descriptive names.
-   **Workflow as Code**: Define the entire CI/CD process in a YAML file (`.github/workflows/ml-pipeline-tests.yml`) for version control and reproducibility.
-   **Dependency Caching**: Speed up CI runs by caching Python dependencies between jobs.

## Input Files/Data Explanation

This week introduces several new files to support the testing and CI/CD infrastructure.

### Testing Infrastructure
-   **`test_pipeline.py`**: The core of our testing framework. It contains over 15 distinct test cases organized into categories like configuration, data validation, model training, and performance. It uses `pytest` fixtures to manage setup and teardown.
-   **`pytest.ini`**: Configuration file for `pytest`. It defines default options, marks directories to be tested, and configures code coverage reporting.
-   **`run_tests.sh`**: A convenience script for developers to run the entire test suite locally with a single command. It performs checks, runs `pytest`, and provides a clean summary.

### CI/CD Pipeline
-   **`.github/workflows/ml-pipeline-tests.yml`**: Defines the GitHub Actions workflow. It specifies the triggers, the execution environment (Ubuntu runner, Python 3.9), and the sequence of steps: checking out code, installing dependencies, running tests, and generating a CML report.
-   **`git_workflow_guide.md`**: A supplementary guide that outlines the recommended Git workflow for developing, testing, and merging code in a CI/CD-enabled repository.

## Sequence of Actions Performed

### Phase 1: Local Testing Workflow

**1. Environment Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to the correct directory
cd week-4/

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Running Tests Locally**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x run_tests.sh

# Execute the local test runner
./run_tests.sh
```
This command runs all checks defined in `test_pipeline.py` and outputs a success or failure summary.

### Phase 2: Git and CI/CD Workflow

**1. Development on a Feature Branch**
```bash
# Create and switch to a new development branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

**2. Commit and Push Changes**
```bash
# After making changes, add and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement my new feature"

# Push the branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature
```

**3. Create a Pull Request**
-   Navigate to the GitHub repository in your web browser.
-   GitHub will automatically detect the new branch and prompt you to create a pull request.
-   Create a pull request targeting the `main` branch.

**4. Automated CI/CD Execution**
-   Upon creating the pull request, the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `ml-pipeline-tests.yml` is triggered.
-   You can monitor the progress in the "Actions" tab of the repository.
-   Once the workflow is complete, a CML report will be posted as a comment on the pull request.

**5. Review and Merge**
-   Review the code changes and the CML report.
-   If all checks pass and the review is positive, the pull request can be merged into `main`.

## Exhaustive Explanation of Scripts/Code and Objectives

### 1. `test_pipeline.py` - The Test Suite

**Primary Objective**: To provide a safety net against regressions by validating every critical part of the ML pipeline.

**Key Test Categories:**
-   **Configuration Tests**: Ensure that the pipeline correctly loads configuration from files and environment variables.
-   **Data Validation Tests**: Check for data availability, schema correctness, and quality.
-   **Model Training Tests**: Verify the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and artifact saving steps.
-   **Performance Tests**: Automatically check if the trained model's performance (e.g., accuracy) meets a predefined threshold.
-   **Integration Tests**: Run the pipeline end-to-end to ensure all components work together correctly.

### 2. `run_tests.sh` - Local Test Runner

**Primary Objective**: To provide a simple, consistent, and easy-to-use interface for running the test suite locally.

**Functionality**:
-   **Dependency Check**: Verifies that required tools like `python` and `pip` are available.
-   **Test Execution**: Invokes `pytest` with the correct arguments for verbose output and coverage reporting.
-   **Clear Reporting**: Prints easy-to-read status messages for each stage of the process.

### 3. `.github/workflows/ml-pipeline-tests.yml` - CI/CD Workflow

**Primary Objective**: To automate the testing process and provide rapid feedback on code changes.

**Workflow Breakdown**:
-   **`on`**: Defines the triggers for the workflow. It runs on pushes and pull requests to `main`, and can also be triggered manually.
-   **`jobs`**: Contains the `test-and-report` job which runs on a GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runner.
-   **`steps`**:
    1.  **`actions/checkout@v3`**: Checks out the repository code.
    2.  **`actions/setup-python@v4`**: Sets up the specified Python version (3.9).
    3.  **`actions/cache@v3`**: Caches pip dependencies to speed up subsequent runs.
    4.  **`Install dependencies`**: Installs all required packages from `requirements.txt`.
    5.  **`Run tests`**: Executes the `pytest` command to run the test suite.
    6.  **`Generate CML report`**: Uses the `cml` command to create a markdown report from the test output and posts it as a PR comment.

## Errors Encountered and Solutions

### 1. **Local Testing: `ModuleNotFoundError`**
-   **Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`
-   **Root Cause**: The required Python packages are not installed, or the wrong Python environment is active.
-   **Solution**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 2. **Git: Authentication Failed**
-   **Error**: `remote: Support for password authentication was removed...`
-   **Root Cause**: GitHub requires token-based authentication for command-line Git operations.
-   **Solution**: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub and use it in place of your password when pushing code.

### 3. **GitHub Actions: Workflow Fails**
-   **Error**: The workflow run shows a red 'X'.
-   **Root Cause**: Can be anything from a YAML syntax error to a genuine test failure.
-   **Solution**: Click on the failed run in the "Actions" tab to view the detailed logs for each step. The logs will pinpoint the exact command that failed and provide its output.

### 4. **CML: Report Not Posting**
-   **Error**: The CML report does not appear as a comment on the pull request.
-   **Root Cause**: The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret might not have the correct permissions.
-   **Solution**: In your repository settings under `Actions > General`, ensure that "Workflow permissions" are set to "Read and write permissions".
